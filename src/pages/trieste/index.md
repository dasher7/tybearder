<div style="text-align:center">
Alone e lonely She stands.
<br/>
<br/>
Like those who walk with their eyes pointing to the sky, to avoid any peek or glance,
<br/>
but still they observe.
<br/>
Like those who sip an amber drink at the bar when outside it’s cold and it’s raining.
<br/>
<br/>
She has been with everyone but never she gave herself to anyone, conquered and never seduced.
<br/>
In her everyone found refuge, only by her hand.
<br/>
In her someone found death, never by her hand.
<br/>
<br/>
Tall and naked, audacious, She stands before you, proud as a warrior.
<br/>
She shows wrinkles and wounds, because She does not deny the kiss of the sun.
<br/>
Jealous of herself, She found her damnation starving for harmony.
<br/>
<br/>
Raw and bloody, on the road left and often ignored.
<br/>
Regal and glaring, taken by her hand and admired.
<br/>
She was the cause of educated men,
<br/>
of barbarian men she has suffered the effects.
<br/>
<br/>
Among men and years, she stood still, utopic constant.
<br/>
She learned to remember and therefore tell with her mouth shout,
<br/>
to guide you with her grey eyes and light you up with a smile,
<br/>
when it's dark and you let yourself be cherished by her curves,
<br/>
in an embrace that absorbs the calm and melancholy waters that wet you,
<br/>
of the sadness that characterizes and enhances her.
<br/>
<br/>
You don't go for her, you surrender to her,
<br/>
charmed, fascinated and warmed by her pearled skin,
<br/>
dominated and crushed by a weight that no one can bear,
<br/>
only her, only her,
<br/>
here is why, when She decides it's your time, you look at her one last time.
