Imagine that you are walking along the main street of your City. In the midst of the crowd, with the caresses of the tangled sounds of people shielded by yours headphones, playing to the rhythm of your mood. The sun is setting and softening the wrinkles of the buildings that embrace the sides of the street. The lights of the shops, hidden by the arcades, decorate the street like a Christmas tree and fill it with smells and perfumes, as if the one the of the woman who has just touched you, without even noticing, armed with black glasses and a quick step, was not enough.
The office is behind us, the day is over. Friends are at the bar, the evening begins.
Close your eyes.

Imagine that you are still, motionless. Embraced by a cold silence, an intermittent light that casts uncertain shadows on the walls. It is night now and there is no more evening. You are in your bedroom, wrapped in that familiar air that is now too used to be breathable. You get up, your legs numb from the little movement, you drag yourself dangling at the window, you move the curtain and look at the emptiness with which the street is full. Judgment day, and someone decided to spare me to punish me, you think. And immediately afterwards a military man passes, armed not with a rifle and not with a megaphone, intending to stay at home: there is an enemy that cannot be defeated with lead.
Close your eyes.

Imagine running. Barefoot, along the seashore, through the pink of a tender sunrise. The smell of the salt that mixes with your sweat, the dry throat and the lungs that tighten, the fatigue that is the master but loses from the joy of being free and not having a horizon that limits you. Dream of being able to get where you want, to infinity and beyond. But then you stop, the hands rest on the knees and the back curves as the breath becomes more and more labored. A drop of sweat falls from the forehead, through the closed eye it makes its way, and from the tip of the nose, it falls to the ground.
Close your eyes.

Imagine you are sitting. Your desk chair has become like a king’s throne, from which to see and hear everything there is to hear about the world. The days seem to repeat, one similar to the other, the night that mixes with the day. You have always wanted more time to devote to yourself, yet you lose in that strange and bizarre mix of stars and clouds. You have always wanted a little silence to be able to listen your own voice, far from the usual noise of the routine, but you are afraid to listen to the echo of the silence that surrounds you. Yet don’t be afraid, listen, now that nobody can see you, you don’t have to hide your heart behind the fireplace. Because if appreciating the busy crowds on Friday is an art, the same goes to populate your loneliness.
Close your eyes.

Imagine that you are walking along the main street of your city. In the midst of the crowd, with the caresses of the tangled sounds of people shielded by headphones, playing to the rhythm of your mood. Open the bar door, your friends are there.
Close your eyes.

The dreams, and the nightmares, the most ugliest, and the beautiful, all end. And if we try hard to remember, we could learn a lot. Because having a bad memory helps one to be happy but true happiness also implies commitment and pain. And we will be happy together.
But not now, now close your eyes, and dream.
