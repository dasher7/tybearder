At the beginning, everything is nothing.
<br/>
Everything gets built by itself,
<br/>
above its roots,
<br/>
which grow and spread even in hostile land,
<br/>
in lands where nothing has managed to grow before now.

<br/>
It’s an eternal process,
<br/>
a process that happens faster than a flash of lightning.
<br/>
It’s something you stand by,
<br/>
terribly hoping to be part of that process,
<br/>
but you’re so focused on who knows what you do not realize it’s already happening.
<br/>
<br/>
Once it has happened,
<br/> a strong feeling,
<br/>
a feeling that gives you warmth,
<br/>
holds you in a hug that gifts you peace and relaxation.
In that moment everything is brighter than usual,
<br/>
everything is warmer than usual,
<br/>
everything is more florid than usual.

But then it burns.
<br/>
It slowly burns,
<br/>
changes his skin,
<br/>
what seems to be his weakness is actually his strength,
<br/>
it spreads his knowledge so that everyone can feed on it.
<br/>
A generosity that seems to end everything but it is just a new beginning.
