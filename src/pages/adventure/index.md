# **Act One: Wanderer**

Once upon a time there was Bì, a little red shiny plastic puppet, different from everyone else.

Bì lived in the world of humans even if he was nothing but human. Bì was named in this way to remind himself he was not wanted, he just happened.

Bì was different from everyone else, he was heartless, but still he can love, suffer, cry, and be kind. Bì was headless, but still he can reason, think and behave wisely.

Bì had no easy life down in the town. Bì was different from all other people, Bì was a little red plastic puppet living in the world of humans, where everyone one has a mouth to speak, a knee to flex, a heart to love and a mind to think, or at least they are supposed to. Being different was hard and Bì always got teased just because he was not like all other people.

Bì could not do much to avoid jokes, he had no mouth to scream and no knee to run fast, the only thing he could do was taking his pencil and a piece of paper and write his thoughts, hoping that one day someone could read them.

One day Bì was, once another time, teased by the people of the town, he was surrounded by folks but then, suddenly, something happened. When things happen, not always they happen for a very reason and most of the time they happen way too fast for us to understand. Bì felt something was catching him and suddenly he found himself in an huge open field, where everything was different from what he was used to. Grass blades tall meters, rocks almost bigger than him, field so wide that he could not see the horizon.

Bì felt he did not fit, he did not belong to that huge, enormous world. It took a while to Bì to get his senses back, he was scared, shocked. Bì just stood still there, in the middle of nowhere, for who knows how long. Bì felt lost, he could not figure out why he was there and what was there, or even who brought him into that world. Bì was different from everyone else and, in his very opinion, he was very strong. With a great willpower Bì managed to get his head back, metaphorically speaking, and he began to think about what could be done.

Bì looked around looking for answers when he noticed he was holding a very long, way too long, wooden branch with a bag attached to the very edge of it. Bì felt that that bag was heavy and light at the same time, he felt like everything he needed was in there, still, he did not know why he had that bag or who gave it to him for whatever reason. Bì felt that that bag was something like a safe spot, something warm and indelible. Looking through those huge grass blade Bì noticed a very peculiar wooden sign. That sign was facing a direction and had an X on it.

# **Act Two: Footprints**

Bì felt lost, again, and started to ask himself way too many questions. He could not gave himself answers, most questions did not have answers.

Bì panicked, his breath was about to fail, he was about to faint, his thoughts was about to get upper hand. Bì was alone, in a cold open field full of green and sharp skyscraper. Bì had no choice, he had to face the unknown. The only thing he could do was to start wandering, following that direction, which strangely was his only safety.

Bì started walking and he walked for who knows how many hours. Time seemed to pass fast while other times seemed to never pass. Bì reached a muddy field, in which he struggled to walk, he felt tired and close to the edge. When Bì took his first step into this new world there was the sun but at that point, in that muddy field, things started to get darker and darker. Night was coming and a mystic fog was about to cover everything beneath his thin veil. When things go wrong, they get worse, Bì was feeling that very sense of fear.

Bì was about to lose his faith, he felt cold, tired, lonely, with almost no energy left. Bì felt like nobody could ever help him. But suddenly, once again, something happened. Bì almost fell of to an edge, an edge that, once a closer look it was given, turned out to be a footprint. Human footprints. Giant human footprints. Just after those footprints a sign, equal to the previous, made out of wood, an X on it, facing a direction that, this time, frightened Bì.

The sign was facing water, a huge expanse of water, bigger than every ocean Bì could remember. Bì was scared since he could not swim. Bì was also scared due to those footprints he just encountered. Had he to face a giant? His faith is to drowned in a dream or get stomped by a giant feet?No answer he could gave himself, and again his thoughts was about to take him over. But this was different, this time Bì dismissed his thoughts and he was sure of a thing: the moment for him to face his fears had come.

Bì took courage and and without thinking twice he stepped into the water, following the direction the sign was indicating. Bì carried the bag with himself, he felt he could not allow himself to lost in any way. At the end, it was very easy. Bì was made out of plastic, and plastic float on the water. Most of the time it is always easier than we think. Bì just let the flow guide himself wherever it leads and let himself be lulled by the warm and vaporous hug of a midnight ocean.

# **Act Three: X**

In that hug, Bì found some relief to all the fatigues he had to face to reach that place.

The night has passed. Or maybe more than a night has passed. Maybe they were two, three, ten, hundreds or who knows how many. In that state, time had no importance. But then, once again, something happened. Bì felt warm, warm like never he felt. A sun was shining, shining like never before. the sky was blue as it had ever been, everything started to look more beautiful, beautiful as he was used to. And from the water, a very particular rock emerges.

Upon that rock a very particular wooden coffer shines his beauty off. All around the rock cherry blossom flowers and and grass reflects themselves into the water.

Bì stepped onto the rock and sit besides that beautiful, as he thought, coffer, a coffer that fits perfectly to him, giving himself a sense of peace. Bì felt no more fears, no more lost, no more unfit, he found what he was unawares looking for. In the end, Bì was happy.
